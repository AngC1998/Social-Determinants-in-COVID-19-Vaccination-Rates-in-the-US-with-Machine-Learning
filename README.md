# Social-Determinants-in-COVID-19-Vaccination-Rates-in-the-US-with-Machine-Learning
In this project, we use machine learning to predict COVID-19 vaccination rates per county in the United States and determine the social determinants that significantly influence vaccination rates and how much influence these factors have on vaccination rates.
